```powershell
# Only required for certificate-based authentication
$appid = '<YourAppIdHere>' # App ID of the App Registration
$tenantid = '<YourTenantIdHere>' # Tenant ID of your EntraID
$certThumbprint = '<YourCertificateThumbprintHere>' # Thumbprint of the certificate
```

3. Run the script in PowerShell.
